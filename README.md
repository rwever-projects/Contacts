# Contacts
## My Contacts Android app: listView backed by SQLite

###### This app stores a list of user's contacts and allows addition of new contacts, modification of existing contacts, or deletion of existing contacts.

###### The goals of this app are:
- to demonstrate navigation in a multi-view android application
- to utilize a listView control with a properly formed adapter/data source
- to use SQLite Database, allowing the user to add, modify, and remove information

###### The application must conform to the following constraints:
- it may not rely on any frameworks, such as Firebase
- it must be a native Android (Java) application

###### The design flow is shown below:
